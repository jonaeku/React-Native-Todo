# React-Native-Todo
Let's build a React Native ToDo app !

## Getting Started

If you are new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started is with Expo CLI. Expo is a set of tools built around React Native and, while it has many features, the most relevant feature for us right now is that it can get you writing a React Native app within minutes. You will only need a recent version of Node.js and a phone or emulator. 

```
$ npm install -g expo-cli
```

```
$ expo init AwesomeToDoApp

$ cd AwesomeToDoApp
$ npm start # you can also use: expo start
```
